# capture your motivation

you're building a system
and you need a component

* search for existing implementations

if you think

that can be built in less than 2 hours

build things because you want them to exist

* so that you can do things that
* to keep an implementation clean

# don't worry

Things you shouldn't worry about:

# benefits of small projects

## voxeljs

## gl-modules

## mathematics

## browserify v2

* module-deps
* browser-pack
* insert-module-globals

## trumpet redesign

* html-select
* cssauron
* html-tokenize
* trumpet

# anti-patterns

* automated publishing without granular versioning, independent repositories

lodash does this presently. Hopefully they will fix some of these problems.

# great collaborating
